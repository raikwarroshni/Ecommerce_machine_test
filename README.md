## some points to be reminds here for api

4. Added default users (admin, user), roles, and categories during the initial setup of the project.

5. I have defined four statuses: 'pending,' 'processing,' 'shipped,' and 'delivered,' where 'pending' stands for added to cart and 'processing' stand for create order.

6. Create an order, remove a product from the cart, and update the order status in the admin section. The API uses _id, which means you have to use the _id from the add to cart list api.

7. you can get category_id from category list api.

8. you can get role_id from role list api.
